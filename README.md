# terminal\_graphics\_by\_pawan\_ansii\_256\_based

A minimal set of tools for creating **256-color graphics directly inside the terminal** using ANSI escape codes.

This is not a GUI library.
This is not a game engine.
It’s a **low-level toolkit** for anyone who wants to push the terminal beyond plain text.

## Features

* **256-color based rendering** (no truecolor, no extras).
* **Pixel-like control** over rows and columns.
* **Write once, use in both C and C++.**
* **Single include file**, no dependencies.

## Why this exists

Because terminal graphics are often ignored.
Because sometimes, you don’t need a full graphics engine — you just need **direct control over characters and colors**.
Because limits (256 colors, fixed rows/columns) force **clean and sharp creativity**.
